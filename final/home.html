        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Aileen Ho. I am a current third-year student at USC majoring in Economics. After graduating, I aspire to be a management consultant. Outside of my studies, I am involved in OWN IT, a one-day leadership summit highlighting female and binary leaders' voices. Outside of school, I like to hike, grab a cup of matcha, explore new places in LA, and I also work for a pretty cool search firm in the firnancial services space! </p>
        <p>This is my digital diary for my time at USC. Here, you'll find information about my life at USC and some career stuff as well. I hope you'll find this helpful as a glimpse into life as a USC student!</p>
