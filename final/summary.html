Welcome to my website! This is my digital diary for my time at USC. Here, you'll find information about my life at USC and some career stuff as well. I hope you'll find this helpful as a glimpse into life as a USC student!

In this website, you'll find a form and the lightbox Lightbox plugin. The link to it is https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/.
